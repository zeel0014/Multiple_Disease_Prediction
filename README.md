## 🎯 Introduction

The Multiple Disease Prediction project aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant medical information and receive predictions for different diseases. Machine learning models trained on disease-specific datasets enable accurate predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, making health screening more accessible.

## ✨ Features

- **User Input**: Input medical information including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and other relevant factors
- **Disease Prediction**: Utilizes trained ML models to predict the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease
- **Prediction Results**: Displays predicted outcomes with clear probability indicators
- **Multiple Disease Support**: 
  - Diabetes Prediction
  - Heart Disease Prediction
  - Kidney Disease Prediction
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive sidebar navigation with clean design
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant predictions using trained machine learning models
- **No Technical Knowledge Required**: Simple interface for anyone to use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Streamlit Option Menu**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Pickle**
